 <h3>Damsel (Netflix)</h3>

Living in a struggling, remote community with her sister, Elodie reluctantly agrees to marry a prince to restore their land's prosperity. Despite her reservations, she is motivated by a sense of duty to help her people.</p>

 <h3>Lift (Netflix)</h3>
 <p>"Lift" is a glossy and generic action film from Netflix, featuring a star-studded cast and a familiar heist plot with con artists attempting an impossible job. Directed by F. Gary Gray, the movie offers some entertaining moments but lacks depth, making it hard to care about the characters. The special effects feel detached from reality, giving the film a video game-like quality.</p>
